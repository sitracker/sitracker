* Setting your status to 'Not accepting' or a status that is not accepting, e.g. 'Absent Sick'
will automatically reassign your incidents to your substitutes as specified in 'My substitutes'

* Setting your status back to 'accepting' will reassign all incidents that have not had any activity back to yourself.
