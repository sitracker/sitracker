Loosely inspired by and based on Aaron Seigo's HACKING file from KDE kicker

You may (will) notice that there are many discrepencies between the current
code base and this document. All new development should follow the coding style
as described below and one day the codebase will actually be consistent! Also
feel free to clean up the code around code you work on.

Text File format
----------------
Text files should be UTF-8 encoded with UNIX style end-of-lines.


Comments
--------
Code should be written with enough clarity that comments are not needed
above each line. However, if the code does something in a particular way
for a specific reason that may not be obvious to the next person who has to
work on it do provide a short comment describing what it does and why.

Excessive commenting should be avoided since if there are too many comments
they tend to get ignored and won't be maintained, causing the comments and
the actual code to drift apart. Innacurate comments are worse than accurate
comments!

While using the /* style */ of comments is ok, comments should use // wherever
possible.

Comments can also provide notes for future work, including:

    // TODO: this is a todo item
    //       and should explain the todo in detail

    // FIXME: this is documenting a bug. It is preferred that they are fixed.
    //      but if you don't fix it, at least document it to save the next
    //      person some time in tracking down the problem.

    // DEPRECATED: this is marking a feature as deprecated, and should
    //             state a version or date when the feature is targetted
    //             to be removed completely


Use Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) format to document functions:
e.g.

/**
 * A function to create foo's out of bar's
 *
 * long description long description long description long description
 * long description long description long description long description
 * long description long description long description long description
 * long description long description long description long description
 * @author Joe Public
 * @param int $bar An existing bar
 * @return int A brand new foo
 */
function foobar($bar)
{
    ...
}



Indenting
---------
Tabstop is 4 spaces. No tabs, only spaces.

Try to keep lines under 80 characters in width. When wrapping a single
logical line of code across multiple lines, new lines should be indented
at least once and should preferably line up with parentheses, if any, on
the line above. e.g.:

    someMethod(parameterOne, parameterTwo,
               parameterThree, parameterFour);

If a boolean expression is spread out over several lines, the boolean
operator is always the last item on the line, e.g.:

    if ((condition1 OR condition2) AND
        condition3 AND
        (condition4 OR condition5))
    {

Switch statements should have the case line indented and the case block
itself further indented, e.g.:

    switch (condition)
    {
        case 1:
            ...
            break;
        case 2:
            ...
            break;
        default:
            ...;
    }


Line Length
-----------
Try to keep all code lines 80 characters or less, certainly anything above
100 characters should cause you to consider splitting onto several lines.
This is except for long strings of HTML that would be harder to read over
several lines and for generated code.


Spaces
------
A single space should appear between keywords and parentheses, eg:

    if (
    while (
    for (

No spaces appear between function/method names and parentheses:

    function(
    someObject->method(

No spaces appear between opening closing parens and the arguments:

    for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i)

Spaces appear between operators, e.g.:

    int i = i + 3;
    someObject->setValue(someObject->currentValue() + 1)


Blank Lines
-----------
A single blank line should appear between if statements:

    if (foo)
    {
        ...
    }
    else
    {
        ....
    }

    if (bar)
    {
        ....
    }

Two blank lines should appear between function definitions:

function foo()
{
    ...
}


function bar()
{
    ...
}


Braces
------
Braces always appear on a line by themself, indented to align with the
above keyword:

    if (foo)
    {
        ...
    }
    else
    {
        ...
    }

Unless it uglifies the code, use braces even for one-liner conditionals:

    if (foo)
    {
        return 1;
    }

If you must use a one line conditional, keep it on one line - don't split it

    if (foo) dothis();

Always use braces if the conditional expression wraps across multiple
physical lines.

Braces around case blocks in switch statements are optional.


SQL
---
SQL Statements (SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT...) and functions (ABS(), MATCH(), TIME())
should be written in upper case with columns and expressions in lower case.

Where clarity will be improved by it use backtick (`) to quote identifiers.

SELECT *, ROUND(age) AS approxage FROM `names` WHERE `names`.id > 100;


SiT Style Conventions
=====================

Database Queries
----------------
After a database query always check for errors, use trigger_error and throw
E_USER_WARNING when reading data and E_USER_ERROR when writing data.

When retrieving data from a database mysql_fetch_object should be used over any
other method.
