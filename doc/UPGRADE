Upgrading Support Incident Tracker
----------------------------------

    Note: Unless you are familiar with PHP, it is not
    recommended to use non-released versions of SiT!
    (i.e. SVN versions).  These versions are not tested
    for general use and there might  not be an easy
    upgrade path for the next release from such
    intermediate versions.

To upgrade simply copy all the new files over the existing ones being
careful not to overwrite your config.inc.php or any custom themes you
might have.

Then run setup.php in your browser and follow the instructions on-screen.

Further instructions and notes about specific upgrades follow, if you
upgrading and skipping several versions listed below you should read
everything carefully to make sure you've met all the requirements:

Upgrading to 3.50
-----------------
    *  The portal knowledge base is now publicly accessible by default. A link is placed on the SiT! login screen to the knowledgebase where all articles with a distribution of 'Public' will be shown. If you do not want this, you can disable this by changing Configure | Features | Portal | Portal/Public Knowledge base.
    * The LDAP code has been extended and rewritten, if you are already using LDAP you should be aware that you will have to reconfigure this after upgrading to 3.50.


Upgrading to 3.45
-----------------
    ** Please read these instructions carefully **
    ** your upgrade may fail if you do not **

The file layout of SiT! has changed a lot from the last release (namely all
files from /htdocs/ are now in the directory above), so the recommendations
are as follows:

    * Backup your /includes/config.inc.php file
    * Backup your /attachments/ folder
    * Backup any customised files, plugins, themes and i18n files
    * Delete all the files from your entire sit install (leaving your
      database alone)
    * Unpack the new version
    * (Optional) If you have set /htdocs/ to be your web root, this needs to
      be changed to be the directory above now
    * Update your $CONFIG['application_webpath'] to point to the new location,
      for example from /sit/htdocs/ to /sit/
    * Move your attachments directory outside of the web root, or make it
      secure using .htaccess (or the equivalent for your web server)
    * Remove any existing php include_path settings for SiT, this is no
      longer required
    * Update your cron to point to the new location of auto.php
    * Edit your config.inc.php file to set $CONFIG['attachment_fspath'] to
      point to the new location of your attachments directory
    * Put your config.inc.php back into the root sit directory
    * Access setup.php in your browser to complete the upgrade

All custom settings that are in your config.inc.php except attachment location
and database settings will automatically be transferred to database storage,
this is an automatic process.

In previous versions it was possible for a single user to have multiple
incident activities running simultaneously, this functionality was never
intended and has been removed for this release (Mantis 434). From this release
onwards only one activity per user per incident is allowed to run at once.

Plugins designed for any version prior to 3.45 will not work with 3.45 without
being modified, see the Creating Plugins page for the latest plugin documentation.

The config variable $CONFIG['support_manager_email'] is now obsolete and has
been removed, if you have configured this it will be ignored. You must visit
SiT! | Control Panel | Configure and to Application | Other to set your
support manager instead, this defaults to the first user in the system,
usually your SiT Administrator.

A new config variable $CONFIG['default_entitlement'] has been created which
allows you to specify a number of days holiday entitlement to give to new
users as they are added. This won't affect any existing users. We've set this
to 21 days, but you can of course alter it.

The SiT integrated spellcheck feature has been removed, it has been
unmaintained for a few years and browsers like Firefox do a much better job of
spellcheck anyway.


Upgrading to 3.41
-----------------
We fixed an incorrect permission on the control panel->notices page
this previously required "View your tasks (69)" permission instead of
the correct "Post System Notices (78)" permission.


Upgrading to 3.40
-----------------
From this version we no longer allow brackets "(" and ")" in trigger
rules, if you have any brackets in your existing rules they will be
stripped out. We don't believe this will cause any problems, if it does
please create a bug report.


Upgrading to 3.36
-----------------
No special actions are required, however you should be aware that
the QBE report now requires Administrate permission (22).


Upgrading to 3.35
-----------------
As of 3.35 we've changed our minimum requirement for php to 5.0.0
as php4 has been end-of-life for some time now and won't receive
any patches at all after 2008-08-08.

This version swaps the load order for config files, if you are
using /etc/sit.conf these values are now loaded first, and then
config.inc.php is loaded next.  This may affect your settings
if you are using both files.  We recommend you use just one
config file unless your needs are very specific.

This version supports table prefixes, if you use this feature
any plugins you have installed that are not designed to work
with 3.35 may break.

The scheduler, auto.php no longer accepts parameters. Scheduled
actions are now configured from within SiT by going to SiT! ->
Control Panel -> Scheduler.

The config variable $CONFIG['tipsfile'] has been deprecated and
is now ignored, tips are now stored in htdocs/help/en-GB/tips.txt
(and similar paths for other languages).  If you have written your
own tips, please consider posting them on our forum so that we can
include them in future releases for the benefit of others.

Sending an email when an incident is logged is no longer made
optional at the time the incident is added.  Logging an incident
now fires the 'Incident Created' trigger which in turn sends an
email based upon the INCIDENT_LOGGED template.
This action can be removed if you prefer.

From this version new incidents will be automatically assigned
to engineers based on the workload (queue size) of each engineer,
the skills required and the online status of the engineers.
This can be turned off and the old (pre 3.35 behaviour) where a
list of engineers is presented and the user is given the choice
of who to assign to by setting the config variable
$CONFIG['auto_assign_incidents'] to FALSE.


Upgrading to 3.32
-----------------
New in this version is the ability for users to set their own
local timezone in their profile.  This will adjust the display
of dates and times to the users timezone.  Users timezones
will default to UTC until they explicity set it by editing
their profile.  You should pass this information on to your
users that reside in timezones other than system timezone.

Incidents can no longer be closed if they have not been
assigned.  It was never intended that this be the case.

Upgrading to 3.31
-----------------
From now on all SiT users must have unique email addresses, this
was previously an expectation but it was not enforced so it is
possible that your database has some duplicates.  This will not
cause any issues unless one of those users requests to reset a
forgotten password, in which case only one of the users owning
the email address will be able to reset.  Additionally if either
of the users sharing an email address edit their profile, they
will be told that email addresses must be unique.

New for this version is support for multiple display languages.
After you upgrade, users will have no specific language defined
in their profile and will therefore use the default language
which you can now configure using the new config variable
$CONFIG['default_i18n'].  You can set this to an rfc4646/
rfc4647/ISO 639 code which corresponds to an existing file
in the includes/i18n directory.
E.g. $CONFIG['default_i18n']='cy-GB';
Users are also given the opportunity to configure a display
language at login and also in their profile, this language
can be different to the default language you have set.

Contracts can now optionally limit the number of supported
contacts.
Some fields for contracts are now accessed via an 'Advanced'
section of the add/edit contract page.


Upgrading to 3.30
-----------------
The minimum supported MySQL version is now 4.0.18, if you have a
version older than this you MUST upgrade it before upgrading SiT.

Previous versions of SiT referred to 'Products' and 'Software', in v3.30
'Software' has been renamed to 'Skills'.  This is because SiT gets
used for supporting more than just software and the more generic term
'skill' seemed more appropriate to how it's used with SiT.
Similarly the term 'Backup Engineer' has been renamed to 'Subsitute
Engineer' to avoid confusion with engineers specialising in backup
software.

There is a new system email 'NEARING_SLA' that is sent to the
configured support manager email and to engineers when an
incident is getting close to going past it's SLA target.
You may want to alter the text of this template or change it's
destinations.

The old search plugin for Firefox 1.x versions has been discontinued
in favour of a new OpenSearch plugin.compatable with Firefox 2 and IE7

The dashboard in this version is much more usable, after upgrading
you may want to visit SiT! -> Control Panel -> Manage Dashboard
Components to install and enable the components that are available
and that you would like your users to be able to access.

This releases adds four new permissions, 'Delete Products',
'Install Dashboard Components', 'Run Management Reports' and
'Manage Holidays' by default only the Administrator and users
with the Administrator role will have these permissions you may
want to review individual users permissions to ensure they
meet your needs.


Upgrading to 3.24
-----------------
Permissions have been added for the new 'Add Reseller' and
'Manage Escalation Paths'  features, no users will have these permissions
after upgrading, you should check each users' permissions (and/or role permissions)
to ensure they meet your needs.

Administrators can now disable accounts by editing a users profile
and setting status to disabled.  If you have redundant user accounts
we recommend you do this now.

Multiple global email signatures are now possible, you may want to
visit SiT! -> Control Panel -> Email Settings -> Global Signature and
add more signatures (to be chosen at random).

Email templates can now store information in the incident log, this
can be set individually for each template, you may want to review
your templates and adjust this.  See SiT! -> Control Panel ->
Email Settings -> Edit Template

Users can now be placed in groups, if you want to group your users
go to SiT! -> Control Panel -> Users -> User Groups

You can now add vendors, you may want to group your products by
vendor, see Customers -> Maintenance -> Products & Software
Add Vendor and see also Edit Product.
For example you may want to group some of your Linux Support products
under Red Hat and others under Mandriva.
It's also possible to edit products and edit or delete software records
you may find it helpful to do some housekeeping.


Upgrading to 3.23
-----------------
As of v3.23 SiT! no longer requires the php.ini setting register_globals
to be on.  Therefore we *strongly* recommend that you make sure your
php.ini has register_globals set OFF, this has been the default since
PHP 4.2.0 but since SiT! previously required it to be ON you should
check your php.ini.

Some permissions have changed with the introduction of the new roles
based permissions system, after upgrading you should check role
permissions and then assign roles to your users, finally you should
check each users' permissions to ensure they meet your needs.

You should read the README file regarding setting up scheduled tasks


Upgrading from 3.20 to 3.21
---------------------------
Email templates can now insert updates into the incident log that are
hidden from the customer view.
You should review your email templates and set the update visibility
of each.

The config variable attachment_path has been renamed to attachment_fspath
and a new variable attachment_webpath has been created for the web view
of the same path.
